## Development Best Practices

### File Organization
- Keep custom themes in `wp-content/themes/`
- Store custom plugins in `wp-content/plugins/`
- Use version control for all custom code
- Exclude WordPress core files from custom modifications

### Security Considerations
- Never commit wp-config.php with sensitive data
- Use environment variables for database credentials
- Keep WordPress core updated through Local by Flywheel
- Regular security audits of custom code

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize images before uploading
- Minify CSS and JavaScript in production
- Use caching plugins appropriately
- Monitor database queries in custom code

## Debugging

### Xdebug Setup
- Configured for port 9003
- Path mappings set for Local by Flywheel
- Use VS Code debug panel to start debugging sessions

### WordPress Debug Mode
Add to wp-config.php for development:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
```

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Updates
- Keep WordPress core updated via Local by Flywheel
- Update plugins and themes regularly
- Review and update development dependencies

### Backup Strategy
- Git repository serves as code backup
- Export database regularly from Local by Flywheel
- Consider automated backup solutions for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File sync problems**: Use manual rsync commands
2. **PHP errors**: Check Local by Flywheel logs
3. **Extension conflicts**: Disable conflicting VS Code extensions
4. **Debugging not working**: Verify Xdebug configuration
